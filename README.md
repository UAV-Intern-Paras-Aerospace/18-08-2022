Successfully configured mission planner to show ranger finder data as batt2 percentage(forgot to take the backup), worked on Personal project drone report, learnt about mavlink.

BRD_PWM_COUNT 4 this will allow the aux port 5 and 6 to be used as GPIO's rather than PWM.                                          
Voltage will always show as 1V as we have changed the type of sensor as flow sensor.
