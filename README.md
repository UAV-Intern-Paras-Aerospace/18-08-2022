Successfully configured mission planner to show ranger finder data as batt2 percentage(forgot to take the backup), worked on Personal project drone report, learnt about mavlink.                                                                          
changed mission planner parameters type of sensor -flow sensor

Voltage will always show as 1V as we have changed the type of sensor as flow sensor
